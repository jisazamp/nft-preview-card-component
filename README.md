## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workfl

### What I learned

The difficulty I encountered in this challenge was to place the overlay for the states in the image. Fortunately, the W3 documentation was very clear in order to implement this point.

### Continued development

As I mentioned before, I want to strengthen my CSS skills when I have to have an overlay or a backdrop. I think this was a good opener.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Image Overlay](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - This helped me to implement the image overlay.
